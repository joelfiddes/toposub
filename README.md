# TopoSUB
TopoSUB is a subgrid method that enhances the efficiency of  distribute numerical suimulations by several orders of magnitude. this problem with a sub-grid method. It relies on sampling the most important aspects of land surface heterogeneity through a lumped scheme, allowing for the application of numerical land surface models (LSMs) over large areas in mountain regions or other heterogeneous environments.
