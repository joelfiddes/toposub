#Issues

#reduce_sample: check how Nclust is updated?

#fuzzymember: new protocol to implementation
1. crisp membership of pixel p1 to sample s1
2. find n (10-20) NN samples to s1 in parameter space
3. calculate membership of  p1 to s1-s(n)

#repetition of code toposub_pre_inform / _crisp (error prone wrt changes in one and not other)
